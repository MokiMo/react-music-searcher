### Description
This project contains some of the *key libraries* that make React great and scalable.
A lot of the used technologies, such as redux, redux sagas and axios are *too much* for a project like this. But they lay the foundation for scaling this app.
**This is not meant to be a complete app, just a demonstration of use-cases of various technologies built.**
